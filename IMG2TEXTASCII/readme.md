# Image 2 Text ASCII

## What it does
This script converts any image into text characters that vary in brightness depending on the original pixel values. The text that the image will be made up with can be specified in the fulltext.txt file. Just change the contents of that file and see what it does.

It's kind of like a image 2 ascii converter but instead of using a characterset it uses any text you give to it.
